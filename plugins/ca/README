Wireshark plugin for EPICS CA, V1.0.3.
=====

This directory contains the Wireshark plugin
 for the Channel Access protocol (CA)
 of Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS).

EPICS is a set of Open Source software tools, libraries and applications
developed collaboratively and used worldwide to create distributed soft
real-time control systems for scientific instruments such as particle
accelerators, telescopes and other large scientific experiments.

Channel access API and protocol provide network transparent access
between EPICS components.

=====

CA plugin dissects all CA header fields.  The channel names are also
tracked along the virtual circuits.  Those fields and channel names 
can be specified in the filter expression to search the packets of
particular interest.

While CA header fields would be fully dissected, CA payload is not
dissected.  Other EPICS tools may be used to read the payload.

How to get Wireshark-CA running:
There are three ways;
(1) Get binary executable.
(2) Get CA plugin binary and put it into plugin directory.
(3) Get CA plugin source code, put it under the wireshak build 
    directory, then invoke make to build CA plugin. 
(4) Get Wireshark source code, CA plugin source code and a patch 
    for Makefile, then build full wireshark by yourself.

In order to build full wireshark versions 1.10.2, 1.4.4, 1.0.0, 0.99.8 or 0.99.7
with this CA plugin, one of these patch files
wireshark-1.10.2-ca-1.0.3.patch
wireshark-1.4.4-ca-1.0.2.patch
wireshark-1.0.0-ca-1.0.1.patch
wireshark-0.99.8-ca-1.0.1.patch
wireshark-0.99.7-ca-1.0.1.patch
has to be applied at the top directory of wireshark for 
Makefile modifications.

You can confirm whether your Wireshark includes CA plugin or not. 
Open Wireshark, select "About wireshark" under "Help" menu, 
choose "Plugins" tab, then you will see "ca 1.0.3".  
Open Wireshark, select "Supported-Protocols" under "Internals" or "Help" menu,
then you will see "EPICS Channel Access" as well. 
Otherwise, you failed to install CA plugin.  Please check the following. 
. If you have several versions of Wiresharks, select a correct version.
. If you install CA plugin binary, check the correct directory. 
  something like /usr/local/share/wireshark/plugins, and 
  $HOME/.wireshark/plugins 
. If you build it by yourself, check the build log. 

See the web for the details.
